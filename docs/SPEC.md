# Nest implementation spec

Nest is the product layer around OrgOps. OrgOps is a pinned, untouched Git
submodule at `vendor/orgops`, sourced from https://github.com/camplight/orgops.
Nest does not keep a second copy of the engine or apply source patches.

## Ownership

| Layer | Owner | Location |
|---|---|---|
| Admin/user interfaces and branding | Nest | `apps/admin-ui`, `apps/user-ui`, `apps/nest-brand` |
| Product API / backend-for-frontend | Nest | `apps/api` |
| Engine HTTP/auth compatibility adapter | Nest | `packages/orgops-client` |
| Product settings and audit persistence | Nest | `packages/db`, `.nest-product/nest.sqlite` |
| Product schemas | Nest | `packages/schemas` |
| Bootstrap CLI | Nest | `apps/cli` |
| Agents, humans, sessions, events, runners, skills, execution | OrgOps | `vendor/orgops` |
| Engine database and runtime data | OrgOps | `.nest-data/nest.sqlite` and `.nest-data/` |

The legacy engine DB path is intentionally retained for existing installations.
It is not Nest's product database. OrgOps remains authoritative for humans,
permissions, agents, channels, events, receipts, files, secrets and runner state.
Nest request handlers never read that database; they use HTTP/WS. Only the
explicit offline migration reads/writes legacy state during upgrades.

OrgOps's engine contract is documented in
[`vendor/orgops/docs/SPEC.md`](../vendor/orgops/docs/SPEC.md). Pinning a new commit
is a deliberate dependency upgrade with lockfile and integration-test review.

## Runtime and processes

`scripts/start-orgops.ts` starts the upstream Hono API using its exported
`createApp` factory and configuration arguments, or starts its original runner.
It sets `ORGOPS_*` environment values from explicit `NEST_*` settings before
loading any engine modules. Engine source is never rewritten.

The launcher keeps the engine database at the existing `.nest-data/nest.sqlite`,
sets a stable absolute runner ID path, and creates `.nest-data/engine` as its
project directory. Built-in skills are copied there on first startup; installed
skills are writable runtime state, not modifications to the submodule. The
engine files directory links to the existing root `files/` directory. Compatibility
links for `.nest-data` and `.orgops-data` preserve standard relative workspace paths.

The product API listens on port 8787 in local development and connects to OrgOps
on loopback port 8788. `ORGOPS_URL` can instead point to an external engine.
`npm run start:api:env` starts both APIs when no external engine is configured;
`npm run start:runner:env` starts the upstream runner and waits for API readiness.
The React development servers proxy HTTP and WS through the product API.

The existing single-container deployment still works: HAProxy listens on 8787,
Nest's product API on 8789, OrgOps on loopback 8788, and the two Vite preview
servers on 4173/4190. The API component launches an internal OrgOps API unless
`ORGOPS_URL` is supplied. The runner is an independently supervised process.
The image includes the submodule source and the parent npm lockfile installs
both product and selected engine workspaces. It never builds the upstream UIs.

Persistent volumes are `.nest-data` (engine), `.nest-product` (product) and
`files` (uploads). Credentials and existing Codex installations remain in engine
runtime storage. Public branding assets remain Nest-owned.

## User workspace home

The user UI opens on a Nest-owned dashboard when no `?channel=` link is present.
Conversation and claimed share links still open the chat workspace directly;
browser Back/Forward restores the dashboard or conversation from the URL.
Dashboard navigation clears the active channel so background messages are not
treated as read merely because the home page is visible.

The dashboard uses the existing visibility-filtered channels and agents, team
membership, and session-local unread message counts. Unread counts follow the
existing notification behavior: a fresh session establishes a baseline, then
HTTP polling and WebSocket events track subsequent messages. They are not
persisted read receipts. Search filters conversations and agents; archived and
running filters use the engine's existing state. No new API or database is added.

Its visual reference is Figma file `Rqfq3v9a8nZfQKbM3Q0NZk`, Camplight dashboard
`923:417` and Nest dashboard `793:2`. Shared instance branding supplies the logo
and palette, with a separate Powered by Nest footer. Original exported icons
are local in `apps/user-ui/public/design`. The first implementation adapts the
reference's cards to available data: agents, conversations and unread messages.
Spend, project progress, issues and community mock data are not implemented.

Conversation and unread-activity cards use a local adaptation of SmoothUI's
[Scrollable Card Stack](https://smoothui.dev/docs/components/scrollable-card-stack)
in `apps/user-ui/src/components/smooth-ui`, with its MIT license retained. The
component uses Motion for stack transitions, dots and previous/next controls,
arrow/Home/End keys, horizontal touch swipes and reduced-motion support. Only
the active card exposes actions to keyboard and assistive technology; vertical
page scrolling remains available. "All" switches conversations to the full list.

Agent portraits reuse Figma's five original characters through `AgentAvatar` in
dashboard cards and chat participants. PNG exports preserve the composed avatar
artwork: Puff (`857:386`, strategy), Moss (`857:396`, research), Muff (`857:406`,
product), Pom (`857:416`, design), Pip (`857:426`, engineering). Files live under
`apps/user-ui/public/design/avatars`. Character names and recognized role words
in agent names select their matching portrait; other names use a stable hash.
NestSystem uses Pip. This is a UI default, not a persisted avatar assignment or
an inference about an agent's capabilities. Failed images fall back to initials.

## Agent directory and settings

`?view=agents` opens the directory and `?view=agents&agent=<name>` opens settings.
The Agents navigation item is selected for both. Reload and browser history
restore these views, and dashboard agent names link to the same detail screen.
Navigating to Agents clears the active conversation. Existing channel/share
links retain their workspace behavior.

The directory uses visibility-filtered agents, searchable by name/description.
Counts describe total, RUNNING and STOPPED runtime records, not task activity or
quality scores. Details load through `GET /api/agents/:name`. Description and
native system instructions save through `PATCH /api/agents/:name`; the existing
engine authorization remains authoritative. Private non-owner settings are
read-only. Names, model, runner, workspace and skills are displayed read-only.
Wrapped agents expose description editing only: native instructions/model/skills
do not control their external runtime. Avatars remain automatic name mappings.

See [ROADMAP.md](ROADMAP.md) for Figma references, acceptance criteria and remaining
project/task/review milestones. These screens do not provision agents or implement
task assignment, performance scores, avatar editing or resource configuration.

## API and identity boundary

Nest owns:

- `GET /health`: reports healthy only when the engine is reachable and healthy.
- `GET /api/branding`: public, no-store; sign-in identity and palette.
- `GET /api/branding/access`: authenticated human's owner capability.
- `PUT /api/branding`: replaces validated branding for the instance owner.

Other `/api/*` and `/v1/*` requests pass through the adapter to the fixed engine
origin. Streaming request/response bodies, HTTP status, uploads and query strings
are preserved. Redirects are not automatically followed. Hop-by-hop headers are
removed. No privileged service token is injected into human requests.

Existing `nest_session` cookies are translated to `orgops_session` on engine
requests and back on responses. A Nest cookie takes precedence if both exist.
The same applies to `x-nest-runner-token`, `x-nest-agent-name` and
`x-nest-channel-id` headers. Legacy OrgOps clients remain compatible.
WebSocket upgrades at `/ws` use the same cookie/header translation and relay
messages to the engine; OrgOps enforces topic visibility and event permissions.

Product ownership is derived through `/api/auth/me` and `/api/humans`: the human
with the earliest `createdAt` (then ID) can manage branding after completing
password setup. Ownership survives username changes. Runner credentials and
Authorization headers are removed from these product identity lookups, so they
cannot elevate branding requests. This version deliberately reuses OrgOps human
identity instead of maintaining a second user/password store.

## Product SQLite schema

`product_settings(key PRIMARY KEY, value_json)` stores the `branding` setting.
`product_audit(id, type, actor_id, payload_json, created_at)` stores product audit
history. A branding write and `audit.branding.updated` record share one SQLite
transaction. This audit is product-owned and does not wake engine agents.

Branding includes displayName (1–60 chars), logoUrl, primaryColor, accentColor,
and backgroundColor. Colors are six-digit hex. Logos allow HTTPS without URL
credentials, `/brand/` assets, or PNG/JPEG/WebP data URLs. Uploaded SVG and HTML
are rejected. The API caps the request body at 360,000 bytes; the UI limits
uploads to 250 KB. New instances use Nest defaults; Camplight values are deployment
configuration. The UI retains a fixed Powered by Nest footer.

## Migration and compatibility

See [SUBMODULE_MIGRATION.md](SUBMODULE_MIGRATION.md). The offline migration first
backs up both databases, then copies legacy branding into the product DB, adds
Nest environment aliases to stored wrapped-agent commands, and removes the old
branding migration marker so it cannot collide with a future upstream migration.
It leaves engine data, agent IDs, runner identity and workspace paths intact.
Repeated runs do not overwrite product branding or double-wrap commands.

The wrapped compatibility prefix is stored in the runtime recipe, not injected
into engine source. It translates ORGOPS_WRAPPED_* to NEST_WRAPPED_* for existing
Nest bridges. New recipes may use upstream ORGOPS_WRAPPED_* directly.

The host deployment controller must initialize submodules, mount/snapshot the
product volume and run the offline migration before starting a new image. Its
rollback restores both databases and the old image. Controller installation is
an operator action; updating this source does not replace the host controller.

## Verification

`npm test` exercises Nest against the actual pinned engine API and WebSocket
implementation plus the offline migration. `npm run test:engine` runs upstream
engine tests separately. `npm run lint` type-checks the selected workspaces;
`npm run build` builds both Nest interfaces. CLI tests use the Node test runner:
`npm run --workspace @nest/cli test`.
